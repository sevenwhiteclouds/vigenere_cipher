Pseudocode: explains how the main function that drives the program works

1. declare a vector of chars to hold the chart
2. declared 5 strings, choice, message, key, shifted message, and file name
to hold corresponding parts of encrypted message
3. declare a boolean to restart the program
4. call a function, pass the vector previously declared to it, and fill in chart
5. print out user menu and take in input from user
6. if the user does not make correct choice keep asking for correct choice
7. if the user selected option to write a file call the function to write a file
and pass the chart and the corresponding string save the output of the function
call into the boolean to restart the program previously declared
8. if the user decides to read a file call the read a file function and pass the 
chart and the corresponding strings to take in and save output and save the
output of the function to the boolean restart previously declared
9. if the user selected to print out the expanded vigenere cipher call the
print vigenere function and save the output of the function into the boolean
restart program previously declared
10. if any the boolean is on from any of the previous saved function calls
keep repeating the menu
11. if the boolean is off from any of the previous saved function calls stop
repeating the menu and exit
12. display output message to user
